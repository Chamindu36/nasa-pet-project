- [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/)
- [React.js](https://expressjs.com/)

## Steps to Run

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Start by cloning the repository to your local machine

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/chamindu36/nasa-pet-project.git
   cd nasa-pet-project
   ```

2. **Build the Docker Image**

   Next, build the Docker image using the following command:

   ```bash
   docker build . -t <USERNAME>/nasa-pet-project
   ```

   Be sure to replace `<USERNAME>` with your DockerHub username.

3. **Run the Docker Image**

   Finally, run the Docker image using the following command:

   ```bash
   docker run -it -p 8000:8000 <USERNAME>/nasa-pet-project
